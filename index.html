    <p>My name is Samuel Rockson; I am 28 years of age, born and raised in Ghana and Spain 14 years in both country cause am both Ghanaian and a Spanish Nationality .we are in a family of 6, my mum , my Dad ,my three siblings and I.Am the first born of my parents, both my parents , my brother David who is after me and I were both born in Ghana (WEST AFRICA), but my 2 other siblings Mikel and Mikela were born in Spain (Girona -Cataluña) near Barcelona  I am a self-driven and self motivated  person. I like to motivate people and help them in their difficult times.<br><br> I was a bright student of my school and do well in the academic and sports activities and because of that i became one of  the best  upcoming soccer player in Spain ( Cataluña) in the year 2011 -2013 , soccer was my dream and passion i dreamt of becoimg a star. I  got the chance in meeting a soccer maneger called Jimmy a catalan man in Spain  who was going to be of a big oppurtunity for me in playing big and well known teams like (FC BARCELONA , FC ESPAÑOL CLUB )and etc..
        <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/">Barcelona FC</a>
        <a href="https://www.rcdespanyol.com/en/">Español FC</a>
        <br><br>I was in the process of joining the FC ESPAÑOL CLUB juvenil  until i heard my soccer manager was arrested and in  the case of drugs at list that's what i heard , it was a very hard and hurting moment  to loose such oppurtunity but thats life for you . but i never gave up i countinue working hard and trainning hard got another oppurtunity in getting chance to enter  FC ALAVES in Spain (ALAVA - PAIS VASCO)
        <a href="https://www.deportivoalaves.com/">FC Alaves</a>
        by a soccer trainer i had at that moment .<br><br>Until one day going for a match between my soccer team and another team i got injured , a very fatal injury (Legamento crusado exterior) 
        <a href="https://www.orthopaedicswa.com.au/services/knee/knee/anterior-cruciate-ligament.html"> Anterior Cruciate Ligament </a>
         which left me at home for about 8 months to a year , i started training hard after on to get myself on the goal again but this time couldnt, any time i touched a ball all of a sadden fear takes over me because of the experience i got through the ijnry and even before that i had an operation of apendis.<br><br>So i decided to go back to school but  since i stopped schooling purshuing my dreams going back to schooling became hard for me i was finding it difficult to catchup with my school mates because of that i had to stop schooling and find a job to do,  i could play soccer again if i train and get fit again but am now grown for that , so to cut everything  short i realized am good at Tecnology and have interest in IT , So i decided to learn coding to see how good i am maby if GOD permits could become a Cyber Security.  Thank God and God bless Codenation https://wearecodenation.com/ am having a course in coding now ,life continue...</p>
